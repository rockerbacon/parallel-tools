# Introduction

Tools for easy multithread programming in C++. The library is built with multilevel in mind, meaning its usage can be as simple as using a for loop or as complex as designing your own thread communication. All its features are built on standard C++ 17.

# Adding to your Project

In case you're using the Assertions C++ Project Manager, the recommended way to add it is with the command:

```
./dependencies.sh add git https://github.com/rockerbacon/parallel-tools.git
```

# Bulding and Testing

This project uses the [Assertions C++ Framework](https://github.com/rockerbacon/assertions/wiki) for all its build, test and external dependencies management.
